## Introduction To C- Programming
C is a powerful, general-purpose programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s at Bell Labs. It is known for its speed, efficiency, and close-to-hardware capabilities, making it ideal for system programming, such as operating systems and embedded systems. C provides low-level memory access, a simple set of keywords, and a clean style, making it a popular choice for beginners and professionals alike. Its influence can be seen in many modern languages like C++, Java, and Python.
## **1. Basic Elements**
The Elements which are used for the programming in C or any other language these elements are used to write the code in the specific language which can be same in all the languages like C++, Java, etc,.. The following Elements are explained based on the C Programming language. The Following are the **Basic Elements** in C programming language.
  1. **Character Set** : Character Set are Used to write C programming and they are Divided into **Four** types.
  2. **Identifiers** : Identifiers are the names of the words that are *pre-determined | User-defined*
  3. **KeyWords** : Keywords are the predefined words which are called as library names.
  4. **Data Types** : Data Types are the Predefined keywords used to store the data in a specific format.
  5. **Constants** : Constants are the values or the integers used in the program.
  6. **Variable** : Names given to the *Memory Locations* or to store a value in the Memory.
  7. **Expression** : Expressions are the combination of variables, Operators, and Operands which can be used to do a task.
  8. **Statements** : A Statement is a set of expression or the set of task.

# 1.Character Set
Character Set are Used to write C programming and they are Divided into **Four** types. The Four Catagories in character set are as Follows:
- **Alphabet** : Alphabets are the characters used in the Character Set which can be Both Lower and Upper Case [a-z = a-97, b-98, ...] [A-Z = A-65, B-66, ...]. These are having their Corresponding **ASCII(American Standard Code Information Interchange)** values.
